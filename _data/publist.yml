- title: "High-spatiotemporal-resolution mapping of global urban change from 1985 to 2015"
  image: SFnews.png
  description: This rate of urban expansion is four times greater than previous reputable estimates from worldwide individual cities, suggesting an unprecedented rate of global urbanization. It is notably faster than that of population growth, indicating that the urban land area already exceeds what is needed to sustain population growth.

- title: "A reversal in global terrestrial stilling and its implications for wind energy production"
  image: STS_news.png
  description: We first found that the stilling reversed around 2010 and that global wind speeds over land have recovered. The strengthening has increased potential wind energy by 17 ± 2% for 2010 to 2017, boosting the US wind power capacity factor by ~2.5% and explains half the increase in the US wind capacity factor since 2010.

  image: PbSpub.png
  description:  We investigate patterns of forest change and cropland expansion in the region for the twenty-first century, based on multiple streams of state-of-the-art satellite imagery and find large increases in cultivated areas that have not been documented or projected. Many of these cultivated areas have evolved from forests that vary in health and status, including primary and protected forests, or from recovering lands that were on a trajectory to become secondary forests.

- title: "Climate mitigation from vegetation biophysical feedbacks during the past three decades"
  image: 1588779288.png
  description:  We isolate the fingerprint of increasing LAI on surface air temperature using a coupled land-atmosphere global climate model prescribed with satellite LAI observations. We find that the global greening has slowed down the rise in global land-surface air temperature by 0.09 ± 0.02 °C since 1982. This net cooling effect is the sum of cooling from increased evapotranspiration (70%), changed atmospheric circulation (44%), decreased shortwave transmissivity (21%), and warming from increased longwave air emissivity (-29%) and decreased albedo (-6%).

- title: "Global evapotranspiration (ET) through coupling a water balance (WB) model with a machine-learning algorithm (the model tree ensemble, MTE) "
  image: evaporation.png
  description:  A satellite-based water balance method is developed to model global evapotranspiration (ET) through coupling a water balance (WB) model with a machine-learning algorithm (the model tree ensemble, MTE) (hereafter WB-MTE). The WB-MTE algorithm was firstly trained by combiningmonthly WB-estimated basin ET with the potential drivers (e.g., radiation, temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and vegetation index) across 95 large river basins (5824 basin-months) and then applied to establish globalmonthly ETmaps at a spatial resolution of 0.5° from 1982 to 2009.
